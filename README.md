## Welcome! I'm Lois. 👋

### About Me
I'm an applied epidemiologist and data scientist. In my current role, I provide technical assistance and data capacity building support to current and future members of the public health workforce across North Carolina.

### Skills
While I can work in many languages, including R, Python, SAS, Stata, and more... you'll most often find me using (and shamelessly promoting) R! I love using R, Shiny, and Quarto to transform, analyze, and visualize data. 

#### A few things I regularly do:
- Pull and wrangle publicly accessible secondary data in R
- Clean and analyze primary survey data in R
- Build and maintain Shiny dashboards
- Develop interactive reports using Quarto

#### A few things previous roles have given me the opportunity to do:
- Monitor trends in public health surveillance data
- Conduct probablistic data linkages
- Research young adult engagement in alcohol consumption harm reduction strategies
- Transform ecological momentary assessment data
- Build robust optimization models to facilitate local data-driven decisions for HIV funding
